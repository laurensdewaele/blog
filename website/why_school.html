          <p>
            I'm having a hard time lately justifying my decisions, or how I
            divide my time. As you may or may not know, I'm trying to launch an
            app myself. I also enrolled myself into school for 3 courses for 4
            months.
          </p>
          <p>
            The courses are 2D for games (photoshop drawing), 3D (blender) and
            math (for animation).
          </p>
          <p>
            Succeeding these courses is more time consuming than I thought it
            would be. It doesn't leave a lot of room for my main goal, creating
            and launching the app. I'm struggling to find the time to actually
            start coding/designing it. It's putting a lot of pressure onto me,
            because I'm getting stressed whether I'll actually be able to finish
            this thing.
          </p>
          <p>Why did I sign up for these courses?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm excited and passionate about art.</li>
            <li>
              I'm interested in finding out whether this is something that I'd
              really enjoy.
            </li>
            <li>I can use these skills in the app I'm creating.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The thing is, maybe 10 percent of what I will learn, I will be able
            to implement into the app, which is my main focus point for now.
          </p>
          <p>So why still do these courses?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The commitment is relatively small. It's only 4 months.</li>
            <li>The community/school is great.</li>
            <li>Meet new people.</li>
            <li>
              I started of a lot things I did not finish. I want/need to prove
              to myself that I can easily do this.
            </li>
            <li>Maybe it will take me to new places.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I'll need to plan carefully from now on, and set good/clear goals.
