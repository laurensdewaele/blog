          <h2>Tools</h2>
          <p>
            You can make perfectly fine blogs with WordPress or some other tool.
            However, imo, if you're a <strong>frontend</strong> developer, you
            have to make it yourself from scratch. And no, not with React or
            Gatsby. Pick the right tool for the job. This is a blog. I mean,
            come on üòÖ.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted my blog to be as simple as possible, for me to write
            content and deploy. I was wondering whether it would make sense to
            write my blogs in markdown instead of html. I chose markdown,
            however, looking back, I'm not entirely convinced.
          </p>
          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I, as a frontend developer, will not have to concern myself with
              cumbersome html tags üòÄ.
            </li>
            <li>
              Euh‚Ä¶ Ah right, I can easily write stuff down on any device. Well,
              not really.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Have to write scripts to convert the .md files to .html.</li>
            <li>
              Conversion can do things that I did not intend to. I do not know
              the inner workings of the program (showdown) that does it.
            </li>
            <li>
              I had to learn a syntax I was not 100% familiar with. I opened the
              <a
                href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet"
                >cheat sheet</a
              >
              constantly. How much traffic would this repo get? ü§îüòÉ
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Looks like I made the wrong choice. Oh well, I have time, and
            scripting is fun.
          </p>

            Asked for some pointers on discord for this last design. They
            rightfully pointed out that I should not use a dark theme for large
            chunks of text. Also I did not like the colors. Quick fix.

          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <h3>Must haves</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a draft folder for unfinished blog posts.</li>
            <li>Create a separate blogpost.html file.</li>
            <li>
              Inject the title, blog post svg and creation date into the
              index.html.
            </li>
            <li>
              All referenced images should be optimized. This means creating a
              mobile, desktop and webP version of the same image and then
              compressing it.
            </li>
            <li>Svg should be inlined for speed (no extra network request).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Nice to haves</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Making it so that it feels like an SPA with simple js.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Oh boy, Alright, let's do this.</p>
          <h2>Code</h2>
          <p>
            I started to code in bash, for learning, but this will take me way
            too long. I'm doing it in node. To quote a friend of mine:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A good developer is a developer who gets things done.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Done blogging now, check out the code on github.</p>
          <h2>After the fact</h2>
          <p>
            I took longer than i thought. Why did i feel i had to code it myself
            (instead of using something like eleventy)?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I'd rather code than learning new APIs</li>
            <li>
              This is a personal website that people, e.g. potential hires will
              see. It must be decent.
