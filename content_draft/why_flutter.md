Unified design is the future.
It makes no sense designing for 2 platforms. What a waste of time, for the designer, as for the developer.
If you can't make a design that users on BOTH platforms feel comfortable with, you're a bad designer.

If you're looking at current mobile designs designers produce, it's with a lot of animation and layering. Flutter is the ideal candidate to handle this kind of stuff. It has great built in animations, etc...

OMG NADER DABIT HAS FLUTTER COURSES ON EGGHEAD? RN IS FUCKED! :D
