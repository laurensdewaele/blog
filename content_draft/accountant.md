# Going freelance

The thing I don't give 2 fucks about is money.
The thing I value the most is my time.
Can you see how contradictive these 2 statements are?
I want to be able to have all the freedom and time I want, but in order for me to do that I need to make at least some money in order to sustain myself. I need about â‚¬1000 a month to get by. And that's living very modestly here in Belgium.
