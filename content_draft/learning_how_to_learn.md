Make blog post about learning how to learn and the **pomodoro technique** and also how fucking distracted you can get.

See it as a muscle that needs to be trained.
Right now you're doing pomodoro's of 4x 25min with 5min breaks, then a big break.

At first it will be difficult, but as with anything, such as your body, you will get used to it and it'll become more and more easy, especially if you make this a habit. Ref. `The power of habit` book.

Be mindful of a false sense of knowledge.

It's only rooted in your long term memory once you have done it yourself. This means, apply the new found logic and make some exercises.

Do this: 

  * Creative environment
  * Persistence and staying the course
