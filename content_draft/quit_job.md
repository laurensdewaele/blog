# I'm quitting my job

This has not been an easy decision for me. I've thought about this for about 2 months and the last month pretty hardcore intensly.
The thing is, I'm pretty junior. I've only done a bootcamp for 3 months, then 'taught' the next bootcamp, which didn't teach me much. Then I proceeded to do an internship of 3 months, that actually taught me a lot of stuff. They gave me the freedom to implement some pretty crucial tasks. So that was good. Then I did a remote job for my previous teacher, which I totally wasn't motivated for and barely did any hours or learned anything. Then I signed my first job, as a javascript consultant. My first job was horrible imo. I was basically just a ticket solver on jira for client. They had some stuff they wanted customized, and I did it. In a pretty unmaintainable code base, and there wasn't any proper communication going on. They also had 'internal' meetings, where consultants weren't welcome in. That made me feel so bad, do they even want to keep me or? Omg. Did that shit for 6 months, had some off time, then worked on an angular app. That was pretty great but wasn't really happy with the outcome because I'm not that skilled in angular. RxJs was hard to learn, plus I was pretty new at testing. Then had some time off, now there's a React Native project coming along. The tech doesn't really favor me that much. It's a long commute, I'll have to do everything myself again without any senior to look up to. It'll be high stress. I also messed around in react native and it's frustating to program in imo. It takes so long to build.

What am I going to do?

Do the stuff I always wanted to do, broaden my horizon. Right now I only know how to do React + Angular. I want to design stuff, which i love, dabble in the backend. Learn a new language, be more pragmatic in coding. Do something I'm actually passionate about which makes me put in more hours than I would at work. Because I was pretty adamant only working 9 - 5. Even that was sometimes hard enough.

I'll be focusing on self improvement, programming and trying to launch an mvp for an app.

'But you're crazy. You don't have enough experience, what a about money?'

I have the money to stretch me max 1 year, not a ton, but seriously, how many people can say that they can take a year off. Plus I feel that I'll be a lot more knowledgable and can charge higher rates.

Also, my best friend who's (in my opinion) a programming genius will be working fully remote and we can share a coworking place.
