## Building the blog

How?
Ofcourse you can do it easily via wordpress or pre-built themes and stuff like that. 
In my opinion, if you're a **frontend** developer, you have to make it yourself from scratch. And no, you can't use gatsby or any other frontend framework for this. Pick the right tools for the job. This is a blog. I mean, come on ðŸ˜….

Sooo, I wanted my blog to as simple as possible, for me to write and deploy.
I like to keep things simple, and I was wondering wether it would make sense to write my blogs in markdown instead of html. I choose markdown, however, looking back, I'm not entirely convinced.

Pros:
  * Dont have to write any tags. Is this really that big of an issue though? I know html.
  * Euh... Ah right, I can just write stuff down on any device. Well? Not really.

Cons:
  * Have to write scripts to convert the .md files to .html.
  * Conversion can do things that I did not intend. I do not know the inner workings of the program that does it.
  * I had to learn a syntax I was not 100% familiar with. I opened the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) constantly. How much traffic would this repo get? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜ƒ

Looks like I made the wrong choice.
Oh well, there's time atm and scripting is fun.
