# Future plans

## A little background

I started my development career 2.5 years ago.

1. Bootcamp, 3 months.
2. Assistant teacher for the next batch at that same bootcamp.
3. Internship at startup for 3 months.
4. Frontend developer at a great consultancy company for 1y and 6 months.

What can I do?

- I know how to write and maintain moderately complex web apps with React, or Angular if I have to ðŸ˜ƒ.
- A bunch of skills/achievements that aren't really worth mentioning.

Writing this, I feel like I'm doing disservice to my knowledge, or that I'm further fueling my impostor syndrome.
I'm not. I'm grateful for what I know already. However, for about a year now, something has been silently gnawing at me. This feeling that I've got to do more, be more, and explore new things.

What do I want to do?

- Design 2D stuff
- Design clean user interfaces
- Think about UX
- Write a basic solid backend from scratch
- Learn a new programming language
- Make 3D objects

But most importantly, **build stuff myself**.
I've never quite had the necessary skills and the chance.

I tried doing some extra stuff after work, but I really struggled.
It was hard to find a project I was passionate about and it was really hard to justify the hours spent learning, vs being with loved ones and doing sports.

However, things have changed. I've found a challenging project that I think I can do myself, and am passionate about.
That's why I've quit my job.

## The plan

People tell me it's risky, that I should start out by doing it on the side.
The thing is, it's not necessarily about the project, it might fail and that would be perfectly fine.
It's all about learning and building new stuff on my own that **I'm excited about**.

Sound all fine and dandy, but what about money?
I'm fortunate enough to have savings that can last me comfortably 5 - 6 months. 8 would be a stretch.
That's okay for me at the moment, it doesn't have to be a massive full-on 3 year commitment or anything.

So what's the plan?

For now the plan is to learn new stuff and try to make an MVP.
I've enrolled myself into [Digital arts and entertainment](http://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/).

Taking following courses (just for 1 semester, 3 months):

- 2D for games.
- 3D low poly.
- Applied maths and physics.

2D and applied maths I can kinda use for my project. 3D is more out of curiosity.
Then on my own, I'll be building stuff with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and Dart.

Wish me luck!

P.S.:

I've already hit a stumbling block.
At school, for the 3D course, they use 3DSMax.
Mac OSX is not supported.

Oh well, I'll do it the hard way and learn Blender instead.
It'll suit me better in the future, with it being open source.
I don't have a dedicated GPU in my mac so I hope it'll be enough. I don't even know if 3D is really something I want to continue, so I'll hold off for now to sell my mac or to buy an eGPU.
