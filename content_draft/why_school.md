# Justifying decisions

![scratching head](./images/thinking_man.svg)

I'm having a hard time lately justifying my decisions, or how I divide my time.
As you may or may not know, I'm trying to launch an app myself.
I also enrolled myself into school for 3 courses for 4 months.

The courses are 2D for games (photoshop drawing), 3D (blender) and math (for animation).

Succeeding these courses is more time consuming than I thought it would be.
It doesn't leave a lot of room for my main goal, creating and launching the app.
I'm struggling to find the time to actually start coding/designing it.
It's putting a lot of pressure onto me, because I'm getting stressed whether I'll actually be able to finish this thing.

Why did I sign up for these courses?

- I'm excited and passionate about art.
- I'm interested in finding out whether this is something that I'd really enjoy.
- I can use these skills in the app I'm creating.

The thing is, maybe 10 percent of what I will learn, I will be able to implement into the app, which is my main focus point for now.

So why still do these courses?

- The commitment is relatively small. It's only 4 months.
- The community/school is great.
- Meet new people.
- I started of a lot things I did not finish. I want/need to prove to myself that I can easily do this.
- Maybe it will take me to new places.

I'll need to plan carefully from now on, and set good/clear goals.
